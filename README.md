## UserScript

If you don't want to install an extension, a more simple userscript can [can be found here](https://gist.github.com/ellielle/e9182e1822d089122db9c8f6981f4ba5).

1. Open the gist page and click the "Raw" button. 

2. If your UserScript extension doesn't pop up to install the script, copy and paste all of it into a new user script. Save and enable it.

## Known Issues

* After installation, any previously open GW2 Wiki tabs need to be refreshed so the extension knows about them.

* Only works on the English wiki currently.

# Building

To build the extension for yourself:

1. Clone the repository using git: `git clone https://github.com/ellielle/gw2-wiki-dark.git`

    - If you are new to or unfamiliar with git, reference GitHub's article on [cloning a repository](https://help.github.com/en/articles/cloning-a-repository).

2. Run `pnpm install` to install the Node packages.
    - If you don't have `pnpm`, [you can install it](https://pnpm.io/installation) a number of ways.

3. Run `pnpm build`, or `pnpm build-firefox`, to build the extension. The extension will need to be refreshed for changes to be reflected in the browser. Alternatively, you can run `pnpm dev` or `pnpm dev-firefox` to build the extension, and then have the dev server watch for changes in code to rebuild it.

4. To test the built extension:
    
    - Chrome:
      1. Go to ```chrome://extensions``` in your browser. In the top right, enable Developer Mode, and click "Load Unpacked Extension". 
      2. Select the `extension` folder in the root project directory.

    - Firefox: 
      1. Run `pack:xpi` to create `gw2-wiki-dark.xpi`. 
      2. Go to `about:config` and set `xpinstall.signatures.required` to false.
      3. Go to `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox`, click the `Load Temporary Add-On` in the upper right of the section. Select `gw2-wiki-dark.xpi`.
