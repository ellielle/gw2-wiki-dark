# Installation

## Chrome

For each new release:

* Download the most current release, make sure to download ```gw2-wiki-dark-chrome.zip```. Extract the files into an empty folder.

* In Chrome, go to ```chrome://extensions``` in your browser. In the top right, enable Developer Mode, and click "Load Unpacked Extension". Select the folder holding the files.

* After installation, make sure the extension is enabled. Reload any GW2 Wiki pages currently open.

* You may delete the folder and ```.zip``` file now. 

<br>

## Firefox

* Waiting on Mozilla approval.

<br>

## UserScript

If you don't want to install an extension, a more simple userscript can [can be found here](https://gist.github.com/ellielle/e9182e1822d089122db9c8f6981f4ba5).

* Open the gist page and click the "Raw" button. 

* If your UserScript extension doesn't pop up to install the script, copy and paste it into a new script. Save and enable it.

<br>

# Known Issues

* After installation, any previously open GW2 Wiki tabs need to be refreshed so the extension knows about them.

* Only works on the English wiki currently.

* No mobile support
