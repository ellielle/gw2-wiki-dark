# GW2 Wiki Dark Mode

This simple extension automatically sets the color theme for the [official GW2 wiki](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Main_Page) to the official Vector dark theme without needing to be logged in. 

<br>

# Installation

<br>

## Firefox

The addon can be [downloaded from its extension page](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/gw2-wiki-dark-mode/).
<br> 

## Chrome

> Note: The Chrome extension isn't available on the store yet.

For each new release:

* Download the most current release, make sure to download ```gw2-wiki-dark-chrome.zip```. Extract the files into an empty folder.

* In Chrome, go to ```chrome://extensions``` in your browser. In the top right, enable Developer Mode, and click "Load Unpacked Extension". Select the folder holding the files.

* After installation, make sure the extension is enabled. Reload any GW2 Wiki pages currently open.

* You may delete the folder and ```.zip``` file now. 

<br>

## UserScript

If you don't want to install an extension, a more simple userscript can [can be found here](https://gist.github.com/ellielle/e9182e1822d089122db9c8f6981f4ba5).

* Open the gist page and click the "Raw" button. 

* If your UserScript extension doesn't pop up to install the script, copy and paste all of it into a new user script. Save and enable it.

<br>

# Known Issues

* After installation, any previously open GW2 Wiki tabs need to be refreshed so the extension knows about them.

* Only works on the English wiki currently.
