# GW2 Wiki Dark Mode

This simple extension automatically sets the color theme for the [official GW2 wiki](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Main_Page) to their Vector dark theme without needing to be logged in.

If you are on a version lower than `0.3.0`, I recommend updating. This extension no longer needs to be built and is no longer in TypeScript.

## UserScript

If you don't want to install an extension, a more simple userscript can [can be found here](https://gist.github.com/ellielle/e9182e1822d089122db9c8f6981f4ba5).

1. Open the gist page and click the "Raw" button.

2. If your UserScript extension doesn't pop up to install the script, copy and paste all of it into a new user script. Save and enable it.

## Known Issues

- Only works on the English wiki currently.

# Usage

To build the extension for yourself:

1. Clone the repository using git: `git clone https://github.com/ellielle/gw2-wiki-dark.git`

   - If you are new to or unfamiliar with git, reference GitHub's article on [cloning a repository](https://help.github.com/en/articles/cloning-a-repository).

2. Make a `zip` archive of the `src` folder and `manifest.json`

Firefox:

3. Install it by going to `about:addons`, clicking the cog in the upper right of the screen, and selecting `Install Add-On From File`, and using the archive you just made.

Chrome:

3. You only need the `src` folder and `manifest.json`, the rest can be moved or deleted.

4. Install by going to `chrome:extensions`, clicking `Load unpacked`, and selecting the folder you cloned into.
